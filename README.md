🌾 Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization  
This repository contains a complete end-to-end project on *crop yield prediction and optimization*, built in two major phases:

1. *Comparative analysis of 8 machine learning regression models*  
2. *GRU deep learning model*

The aim is to evaluate how traditional ML algorithms perform compared to a deep learning architecture that learns temporal or sequential patterns in agricultural data.
